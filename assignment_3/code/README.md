# Robot Environment Interaction Using TurtleBot

Andreia Rodrigues, Eduardo Leite, Francisco Queir√≥s and Vincent De Clercq for Robotics (ROBO) course unit from Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering at FEUP.
Developed and tested using a Ubuntu 16.04.5 system with ROS Kinetic.

### Installation intructions:

1. Follow [setup for the TurtleBot3](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/pc_setup/).

2. In the created Catkin workspace add this repository as a package.

3. Build the workspace with the following command:
    ```
    catkin_make
    ```

### To run the software
1. Setup
    * Physical TurtleBot3:
        1. Follow [setup for the TurtleBot3](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/joule_setup/#install-linux-ubuntu).
	    2. Bringup the sensors by following [point 7.1 and 7.2 of this guide](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/bringup/#bringup). (turtlebot3_robot.launch and turtlebot3_realsense.launch necessary)

    * Open a second terminal and deploy the robot:
		1. Open the simulation world on Gazebo by running:
		    ```
		    roslaunch robofinal world.launch
		    ```
2. Run the program by executing the following command while having the Catkin workspace as work directory of the shell
    ```
    rosrun robofinal robofinal <execution mode>
    ```
    Where execution mode should be specified like so:
	* 0 - Follow Wall
	* 1 - Follow Line
	* 2 - Follow Object
	* 3 - Avoid Object
